  <h1>Open Designs. Open Tools. Total Freedom.</h1>

## Welcome to EnderWorks!

We believe great designs should be free.

Not just "free to download," but truly **free**—free to open, study, change, and build upon.

For too long, innovation has been trapped in proprietary files (`.sldprt`, `.iam`, `.dwg`) that lock you into expensive software.

**We're here to change that.**

## Our Philosophy: Open Tools for Open Designs

We don't just share files; we liberate the entire design process.

* **No Proprietary Locks. Ever.** All our projects are built from the ground up using 100% Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
* **Powered by FreeCAD.** We build with amazing tools like [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), so you get the *full parametric design history*—not just a "dead" file.
* **For the Community, By the Community.** These tools and designs can't be bought or sold. They belong to everyone.

## Get Involved!

You have the power to help us build this library.

* **Contribute** a FreeCAD model you've made.
* **Build** one of our designs and give feedback.
* **Find** a bug or suggest an improvement.
* **Share** our mission with your local makerspace!

**Freedom to build. Freedom to share. Freedom to learn.**
